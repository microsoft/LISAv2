# Description:
# 1. verify that the KVP Daemon is running
# 2. run the KVP client tool and verify that the data pools are created and accessible
# 3. check kvp_pool file permission is 644
# 4. check kernel version supports hv_kvp
# 5. Use lsof to check the opened file number belonging to hypervkvp process does not increase
#    continually. If this number increases, maybe file descriptors are not closed properly.
#    Here check duration is after 2 minutes.
# 6. Check if KVP pool 3 file has a size greater than zero.
# 7. At least 11 (default value, can be changed in xml) items are present in pool 3.

Install LISA on Linux
=====================

We will guide you through the installation of LISA on Linux.

Install Python on Linux
-----------------------

LISA has been tested on `Python 3.8 64
bits <https://www.python.org/>`__. The latest version of Python 3 is
recommended. If you found LISA is not compatible with higher version
Python, `please file an
issue <https://github.com/microsoft/lisa/issues/new>`__.

Run following commands to install Python 3.8 in Ubuntu 20.04.

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa -y
   sudo apt install python3.8 python3.8-dev -y

Install dependencies on Linux
-----------------------------

In Linux, for example, on Ubuntu 20.04, please use the command below to
install the dependencies:

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt install git gcc libgirepository1.0-dev libcairo2-dev virtualenv python3-pip -y
   pip3 install virtualenv

Clone code
----------

.. code:: sh

   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/lisa.git
   cd lisa

Install Poetry on Linux
-----------------------

Poetry is used to manage Python dependencies of LISA.

.. warning::
   
   Please enter the root folder of LISA source code to run
   following commands to install poetry, since Poetry manages dependencies
   by the working folder.

.. code:: bash

   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/install-poetry.py | python3 -

After running this, you should see
``Add export PATH="/home/YOURUSERNAME/.local/bin:$PATH" to your shell configuration file``
on the console. Then do

.. code:: bash

   source $HOME/.profile
   poetry install

Verify installation
-------------------

``lisa.sh`` is provided in Linux to wrap ``Poetry`` for you to run LISA
test.

In Linux, you could create an alias for this simple script. For example,
add below line to add to ``.bashrc``:

.. code:: bash

   alias lisa="./lisa.sh"

With no argument specified, LISA will run some sample test cases with
the default runbook (``examples/runbook/hello_world.yml``) on your local
computer. In the root folder of LISA, you can run this command to verify
your local LISA environment setup. This test will not modify your
computer.

.. code:: bash

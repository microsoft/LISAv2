# Partner Jenkins Pipeline Operation Instruction

## Objective

This document provides instructions for partners to create their own customized menu for the Jenkins pipeline and to run Microsoft-provided tests and/or customized test cases in Jenkins. This instruction has 2 major parts; creating the menu from XML files and executing the tests. Creating a custom menu may be optional for your test development. If you keep the same menu structure and add new tests into the existing menu, you will only update the existing XML files in **./XML/TestCases/**

If you add a custom test menu, you will need to re-build the Jenkins menu, and then can run new tests.

## Develop tests in GitHub

`Source: https://github.com/LIS/LISAv2`

    1. ./XML folder: pre-defined global configuration and account information as well as Region information.
        This folder also has two sub folders; 'TestCases' and 'VMConfigurations'. 'VMConfigurations' has the
        list of xml files for each test case, which require the list of VM configuration information.
        'TestCases' folder has the list of xml files for each test category. The master branch is owned by
        Microsoft, and actively manages changes in LISAv2. New test case development and/or new menu
        development must be approved by Microsoft.
    2. 'Testscripts' folder has the number of test scripts used in TestCases, and separated by OS type.
    3. 'Tools' folder has binary files required for test execution.
    4. This repo will provide Microsoft-provided test cases as well as capability of Partner-developed test cases.
        a. Microsoft will share the test development plan and its log with partners. If you only execute
            Microsoft-provided tests, you can skip to the next section ‘Verify a published image on Azure’.
        b. Partner-developed test cases should follow these steps:
            i.   Sync up the local 'master' branch from remote 'master' branch in the GitHub project,
                 if new work branch is in the LISAv2. Otherwise, you can folk the LISAv2 repo to your own GitHub
                 account.
            ii.  Branch out for work and pull down to your local system.
            iii. Once a change is ready to review, create a Pull Request from LISAv2 in your account to LIS account.
                 Or, new working branch to master in LISAv2 repo.
            iv.  Add ‘LisaSupport@microsoft.com’ to ‘Reviewers’, or send email to 'lisasupport@microsoft.com'.
            v.   Once it is approved, you can merge the Pull Request to master branch. In this case, you will need
                 to rebuild the menu by ‘<Partner name>-Refresh-Test-Selection-Menus’.
    5. LISAv2 has defined some global variables. Test cases can use them as needed.
        a. Read-only global variables
            i. Common
                $TestID : The unique ID of the test run
                $WorkingDirectory: The current working directory of test run
                $LogDir: The logging directory
                $detectedDistro: The distro name of the test VM
                $BaseOsVHD : The VHD name if the test runs with a VHD
                $RGIdentifier: The ID included in the resource group name or HyperV group name. For Ready test platform, it should be <ip_address:ssh_port> to identify the SUT location
                $TestLocation: The Azure region, HyperV servers or WSL host
                $TestPlatform: Azure, HyperV, Ready or WSL
                $user: The user name of the VM
                $password: The password of the VM
                $GlobalConfig: The global configuration xml
                $XmlSecrets: The secret file xml
                $resultPass: PASS
                $resultFail: FAIL
                $resultAborted: ABORTED
                    ; It's the case the test has the right procedure, but its step stopped or failed due to another issues beyond verifications
                    such as dependency package inaccessible, repo access issue, or no result from Get-VM commands, for example.
                $resultSkipped: SKIPPED
                    ; It's the case the test bypassed the procedure like unsupported distro or kernel versions. It comes with invalid condition or procedures.

            ii. For Azure
                $ARMImageName: The ARM image name
                $SharedImageGallery: The shared image gallery path

            iii. For HyperV
                $HyperVInstanceSize: The VM size of VM on HyperV
                $DependencyVmName: The name of the dependency VM for test on HyperV
                $DependencyVmHost: The host name of the dependency VM for test on HyperV
                $VMGeneration: VM generation, 1 or 2

        b. Writeable global variables
                $LogFileName: The name of the log file

## GlobalConfigurations.xml in XML folder

Pre-defined global configuration. We do not recommend making changes to this file.

## RegionAndStorageAccounts.xml in XML folder

It has pre-defined region information. We do not recommend making changes to this file.

## TestToRegionMapping.xml in XML folder

This XML file defines the regions per Category. It may require a specific region only for available setup/resources. By default, 'global' has all regions.

## XML files in XML/TestCases folder

    This location has the list of XML files for test cases. Each XML file names after category
    for each maintenance / sharing.
        1. CommunityTests.xml: Tests from Open Source Community.
        2. FunctionalTests-[FEATURE NAME].xml: Tests specific to a certain feature.
        3. FunctionalTests.xml: Miscellaneous feature tests for other areas.
        4. NestedVmTests.xml: Nested KVM and nested Hyper-V tests.
        5. Other.xml: If any does not fall into existing Category, add to here.
        6. PerformanceTests.xml: Performance test cases.
        7. StressTests.xml: Network traffic and storage IO testing under heavy CPU and Memory stress.

    Here is the format inside of TestCases.xml file. TODO: Revise the definition, and required field or not.
    [Req] Required
        For Azure, <setupType>TwoVM1Dep</setupType>
        For Hyper-V, <setupType>TwoVM</setupType>.
    [Opt] Optional
        <testName></testName>: Represent unique Test Case name [Req]
        <testScript></testScript>: test script file name [Opt]
        <PowershellScript></PowershellScript>: Actual launch PS script file name. [Req]
        <files></files>: If test requires data files, add the file names here [Opt]
        <setupType></setupType>: The name represents VM definition in <Category name>TestsConfigurations xml file,
            VMConfigurations folder. [Req]
        <Platform></Platform>: Supported platform names. Azure, HyperV, Ready, and WSL. [Req]
        <Category></Category>: Available Test Category [Req]
        <Area></Area>: Test Area [Req]
        <Tags></Tags>: Tag information seperated by comma [Opt]

## TestsConfigurations.xml in XML/VMConfigurations

Per Category, each XML file has VM name, Resource Group name, etc. We do not recommend to make the change of the file.

## Basic standard of code changing

    1. Any change should be reviewed and signed off with more than 1 person via PR process. Do not make a change to the master branch directly.
    2. Squash multiple commits to a single in PR review. [here](https://github.com/wprig/wprig/wiki/How-to-squash-commits).
    3. Post the change base test result in PR, if possible. Apply to the most of cases.
    4. PR description must have clear information about new change.
    5. Follow the PR communication in timely manner.

## Add test case in Azure

    1. Design test case and its configuration.
    2. Create a new test case xml file under ./XML/TestCases folder. Or, update with new tags
        in the existing xml file.
    3. Define testName, PowershellScript, setupType, Platform, Category, and Area as required.
        Add optional tag if needed.
    4. Test design may have two ways;
        a. A single PowerShell script execution: A single PowerShell script imports builtin library
            modules and posts the result. For example, 'VERIFY-DEPLOYMENT-PROVISION.ps1' shows
            this script calls 'Deploy-VMs' function for its testing and collect the result
            by 'Check-KernelLogs'. 'Deploy-VMs' and 'Check-KernelLogs' are functions definded
            in ./Libraries/CommonFunctions.psm1 module.
            You can add new module or update existing ones for further development.
        b. PowerShell script wraps multiple non-PowerShell script like Bash or Python scripts:
            Like 'VERIFY-TEST-SCRIPT-IN-LINUX-GUEST.ps1', the PowerShell script wraps the multiple
            Bash or Python script as a parameter of 'Run-LinuxCmd' function.
    5. Before PR review, we recommend you run script testing in cmdline/API mode. See above instruction.
    6. Current tags in the Repo: network, nested, hv_storvsc, stress, disk, dpdk,
        sriov, kvm, smb, storage, boot, pci_hyperv, core, wala, lsvmbus, synthetic, kvp,
        gpu, hv_netvsc, ltp, lis, fcopy, memory, backup, gen2vm. They are all lowercases.

## Coding Style

    1. Reuse existing module, consolidate similar modules before you add or extend new function or file.
    2. Remove duplicated methods or modules.
    3. Remove commented code snippets and personal information.
    4. Review file header comments.
    5. Enforce code convention.
    6. Clean coding in open source tools; PSScript-Analyzer, pep8, etc.
    7. Use tab for indentation.
    8. Test log clean up requires:
        a. Log should be readable to reflect what’s happening in the test execution.
        b. Remove noise. Determine if it would be error or warning.
        c. Exception only in the case of fatal errors.
    9. Recommended Bash & Python function name format - Function_Name(). Upper letter in each string connected
        with underscore character. PowerShell function name format remains Verb-Entity() format like Get-VMSize().
    10. Use the same terminology:
        a. PASS
        b. FAIL
        c. ABORTED (all upper cases)
        d. SKIPPED
    11. TestCase names in XML files are in all Capital.
    12. In PowerShell scripts,
        a. Write-LogInfo: Inform out the context
        b. Write-LogWarn: It's warning but not failed or error.
        c. Write-LogDbg: debugging log only
        d. Write-LogErr: printing error log but does not associate to test failure. Needs to work with throw, resultAborted or resultFail
    13. In Bash scripts,
        a. LogMsg: Logging goes to TestExecution.log file
        b. LogErr: Logging goes to TestExecutionError.log. It also updates the summary.log file.

## Use recommended distro name
